	abstract = {What is the relation between monetary policy and inequalities in income and wealth? This question has received insufficient attention, especially in light of the unconventional policies introduced since the 2008 financial crisis. The article analyzes three ways in which the concern central banks show for inequalities in their official statements remains incomplete and underdeveloped. First, central banks tend to care about inequality for instrumental reasons only. When they do assign intrinsic value to containing inequalities, they shy away from trade-offs with the standard objectives of monetary policy that such a position entails. Second, central banks play down the causal impact monetary policy has on inequalities. When they do acknowledge it, they defend their actions by claiming that it is an unintended side effect, that it is temporary, and/or that any alternative policy would fare even worse. The article appeals to the doctrine of double effect to criticize these arguments. Third, even if one accepts that inequalities should be contained and that today’s monetary policies exacerbate them, is it both desirable and feasible to make containing inequalities part of the mandate of central banks? The article analyzes and rejects three attempts on the part of central banks to answer this question negatively.},

We show that standard theories, which build on a random growthmechanism, generate transition dynamics that are too slow relative to those observedin the data. We then suggest two parsimonious deviations from the canonical modelthat can explain such changes: “scale dependence” that may arise from changes inskill prices, and “type dependence,” that is, the presence of some “high-growth types.”These deviations are consistent with theories in which the increase in top income in-equality is driven by the rise of “superstar” entrepreneurs or managers.},

	abstract = {Debt levels have surged since the mid-1990s and have reached historic highs across the {OECD}. High debt levels can create vulnerabilities, which amplify and transmit macroeconomic and asset price shocks. Furthermore, high debt levels hinder the ability of households and enterprises to smooth consumption and investment and of governments to cushion adverse shocks. The empirical evidence suggests that when private sector debt levels, particularly for households, rise above trend the likelihood of recession increases. Measures of financial leverage give less warning and typically only deteriorate once the economy begins to slow and asset prices are falling. Government debt typically rises after the onset of a recession, suggesting that there is a migration of debt across balance sheets. Some policies, such as robust micro prudential regulation and frameworks to deal with debt overhangs and maintain public debt at prudent levels, can help economies withstand adverse shocks. Other policy options, such as addressing biases in tax codes that favour debt financing and targeted macro-prudential policies, will help bring down debt levels and address future run ups in debt.},

We find a large decline of the top 10\% wealth share from the 1910s to the 1980s, mostly to the benefit of the middle 40\% of the distribution. Since the 1980s-90s, we observe a moderate rise of wealth concentration, with large fluctuations due to asset price movements. In effect, rising inequality in saving rates and rates of return pushes toward rising wealth concentration, in spite of the contradictory effect of housing prices. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how the combination of unequal saving rates, rates of return and labor earnings leads to large multiplicative effects and high steady-state wealth concentration. Small changes in the key parameters appear to matter a lot for long-run inequality. We discuss the conditions under which rising concentration is likely to continue in the coming decades.},

One particularly pressing question surrounds the conditions under which mortgage borrowers enter distress, ie get into arrears or default. This paper develops a novel micro dataset from residential mortgage loans which {UK} banks and building societies have pre-positioned with the Bank of England for use as collateral in exchange for central bank funding. The dataset is used to investigate the determinants of borrower distress as a function of borrower and loan-level stock/flow characteristics over the loans’ lifetime in the buy-to-let ({BTL}) and owner-occupier ({OO}) mortgage markets. We find systematic differences between these two markets, controlling for a range of loan and borrower characteristics as well as macro variables. Our main result shows that, adjusting for affordability, the loan-to-value ratio is reliably more important for borrower distress in the {OO} market than for distress in the {BTL} market, contradicting {McCann}’s (2014) results.},

Recent studies have demonstrated a reduction in property values due to neighboring foreclosures-known as the foreclosure contagion effect. This study uses an agent-based modeling approach to explore market-wide emergent behavior that results from the interconnected property-agent behavior. Specifically, we find that the magnitude of the foreclosure contagion effect is a less powerful cause of eventual market collapse than the time a foreclosed property is allowed to linger on the market. This is important because disposition time is much easier to address from a policymaker perspective than is the strength of the foreclosure contagion effect. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC}.},

The model is a synthesis of the leading approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework exhibits a "financial accelerator", in that endogenous developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness, which allows us to study how credit market frictions may influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data. Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets. Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial accelerator has a significant influence on business cycle dynamics.},

	abstract = {The Great Recession that followed the financial crisis of 2007 is not only the largest economic crisis after the Great Depression of the 1930s, it also signals a crisis of economics as a discipline. This is not only the consequence of the inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics, and specifically the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium ({DSGE}) workhorse model, to forecast such a huge event, or at least to detect the worrying tendencies towards it. Even more relevant is the choice to explicitly avoid the modeling of large crises (that for someone is a motivation for not attacking pre-crisis {DSGE} models focused on the analysis of small deviations from the steady-state), so denying the intrinsic nature of capitalism, a system that necessarily proceeds through cycles and (extended) crises. The replies of the {DSGE} approach to critics have led to extensions regarding for instance the role of financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and bounded rationality (though typically in the form of quasirational expectations). The alternative paradigm of agent-based ({AB}) macroeconomics can take into account all these elements at once within an evolutionary modeling framework based on heterogeneity and interaction, so capable to endogenously reproduce complex dynamics, from small fluctuations to large crises, due to innovation and industrial dynamics, rising inequality and financial instability, and so on. The integration between {AB} macroeconomics and the (post-Keynesian) stock-flow consistent approach represents a promising way for the future development of this research field.},

The artificial economy includes different economic agents that interact using simple behavioral rules through various markets, i.e., the consumption goods market, the labor market, the credit market and the housing market. A set of computational experiments, based on numerical simulations of the model, have been carried out in order to explore the effects of different households' creditworthiness conditions required by the banking system to grant a mortgage. The authors find that easier access to credit inflates housing prices, triggering a short run output expansion, mainly due to the wealth effect. Also, with a more permissive policy towards household mortgages, and thus higher levels of credit, the artificial economy becomes more unstable and prone to recessions usually caused by falling housing prices. Often the authors find that an initial crisis can leave firms in a fragile state. If the situation is not cured, a subsequent crisis can lead to mass bankruptcies of firms with catastrophic effects on the credit sector and on the real economy. With stricter conditions on household mortgages the economy is more stable and does not fall into serious recessions, although a too severe regulation can slow down economic growth. --},

	abstract = {Several independent datasets concerning household behavior in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area are combined to create an agent-based model of the recent housing market bubble and its aftermath. Comprehensive data on housing stock at-tributes, primarily from local government sources, are used as input to the model, as are administratively-complete data on household characteristics. Data covering all real estate transactions over the period 1997-2009 are used as targets for model output, including inventory levels and average days-on-market in addition to price statistics. Finally, a very large sample of mortgage service data (80-90 percent coverage of metro D.C.) serve as both input to the model (e.g., mortgage types, interest rates obtained) as well as target output (e.g., refinancing rates, foreclosure levels). The model consists of a large number of heterogeneous households who make rent or buy decisions, are matched to homes and commonly seek mortgages with which to purchase homes. These house-holds have homogeneous rules of behavior but heterogeneous realized behavior since decisions depend on local household characteristics (e.g., size, composition, financials). This is a so-called agent-based computational model since each household and the banks originating mortgages are software agents while each home and each mortgage are soft-ware objects. The model is capable of running at full-scale with the metrpolitan D.C. housing market, over 2 million households. Overall, we find that certain empirically-grounded household decision rules are capable of generating a home price bubble much like what was observed during this time period. The model does not get the absolute bubble level and the timing of its bursting exactly right but does a good job on certain market 'internals' such as real estate sales, inventories and market tightness. Not in the model at present are fine-grained aspect of household decision-making (e.g., moving in advance of schools starting) and thus the model lacks certain well-known temporal phenomena like seasonality. Also, while the home purchase market is deeply represented in the model, few details of the rental market are present, a further weakness. These limitations and parameter sensitivities are described. Despite these flaws, we use the calibrated model to perform a few policy experiments. Our preliminary findings are that tighter interest rate policies would have done little to attenuate the price bubble, while limiting household leverage would have had a larger effect.},

We show that small, temporary shocks to technology or income distribution can generate large, persistent fluctuations in output and asset prices.},

The model simulations show two main results. First, the {LTV}-rule mitigates the volatility of credit more effectively than the {BC} regulation because the relaxed collateral limit on the {LTV} ratio stimulates credit demand. The inverse relation of leverage definitions accounts for the stronger de-amplification stemming from countercyclical leverage constraints of borrowers. Second, if the financial shock affects the macroeconomy exclusively over the private mortgage market, neither of both rules attenuates the negative output effect, since borrowers and savers consumption effects cancel out. These results reveal that countercyclical regulation of borrowers represents an important complement to {BC}-regulation for safeguarding financial stability.},

First, agents hold diversified portfolios that link their financial positions to those of other agents. Second, shocks to fundamentals at the initial date cause some portfolio losses. Agents who incur losses reallocate their portfolios, thereby breaking some linkages. In the Pareto-efficient symmetric equilibrium studied, two related types of financial crisis can occur in response. One occurs gradually as losses spread, breaking more links. The other type occurs instantaneously when forward-looking agents preemptively shift to safer portfolios to avoid future losses from contagion. An economy is more fragile the earlier its last remaining link breaks from such a crisis. Journal of Economic Literature Classification Numbers: C7, E00, E3, E44, G1. © 2001 Academic Press.},

In this sense rising inequality should be regarded as a root cause of the present crisis. I identify four channels by which it has contributed to the crisis. First, rising inequality creates a downwards pressure on aggregate demand since poorer income groups have high marginal propensities to consume. Second, international financial deregulation has allowed countries to run larger current account deficits and for longer time periods. Thus, in reaction to potentially stagnant demand, two growth models have emerged: a debt-led model and an export-led model. Third, (in the debt-led growth models) higher inequality has led to higher household debt as working-class families have tried to keep up with social consumption norms despite stagnating or falling real wages. Fourth, rising inequality has increased the propensity to speculate as richer households tend to hold riskier financial assets than other groups. The rise of hedge funds and of subprime derivatives in particular has been linked to rise of the super-rich.},

	volume = {17},
	abstract = {Agent-based models are increasingly used to address questions regarding real-world phenomena and mechanisms; therefore, the calibration of model parameters to certain data sets and patterns is often needed. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is an important part of the development and analysis of any simulation model. By exploring the sensitivity of model output to changes in parameters, we learn about the relative importance of the various mechanisms represented in the model and how robust the model output is to parameter uncertainty. These insights foster the understanding of models and their use for theory development and applications. Both steps of the model development cycle require massive repetitions of simulation runs with varying parameter values. To facilitate parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis for agent-based modellers, we show how to use a suite of important established methods. Because {NetLogo} and R are widely used in agent-based modelling and for statistical analyses, we use a simple model implemented in {NetLogo} as an example, packages in R that implement the respective methods, and the {RNetLogo} package, which links R and {NetLogo}. We briefly introduce each method and provide references for further reading. We then list the packages in R that may be used for implementing the methods, provide short code examples demonstrating how the methods can be applied in R, and present and discuss the corresponding outputs. The Supplementary Material includes full, adaptable code samples for using the presented methods with R and {NetLogo}. Our overall aim is to make agent-based modellers aware of existing methods and tools for parameter estimation and sensitivity analysis and to provide accessible tools for using these methods. In this way, we hope to contribute to establishing an advanced culture of relating agent-based models to data and patterns observed in real systems and to foster rigorous and structured analyses of agent-based models.},

The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide ({DMS}), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {We take the model of Alfarano et al. (J Econ Dyn Control 32:101–136, 2008) as a prototype agent-based model that allows reproducing the main stylized facts of financial returns. The model does so by combining fundamental news driven by Brownian motion with a minimalistic mechanism for generating boundedly rational sentiment dynamics. Since we can approximate the herding component among an ensemble of agents in the aggregate by a Langevin equation, we can either simulate the model in full at the micro level, or via an approximate aggregate law of motion. In the simplest version of our model, only three parameters need to be estimated. We explore the performance of a simulated method of moments ({SMM}) approach for the estimation of this model. As it turns out, sensible parameter estimates can only be obtained if one first provides a rough “mapping” of the objective function via an extensive grid search. Due to the high correlations of the estimated parameters, uninformed choices will often lead to a convergence to any one of a large number of local minima. We also find that the efficiency of {SMM} is relatively insensitive to the size of the simulated sample over a relatively large range of sample sizes and the {SMM} estimates converge to their {GMM} counterparts only for large sample sizes. We believe that this feature is due to the limited range of moments available in univariate asset pricing models, and that the sensitivity of the present model to the specification of the {SMM} estimator could carry over to many related agent-based models of financial markets as well as to similar diffusion processes in mathematical finance. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

The problem of designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs, and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs, or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

We find that the application to the estate data of mortality multipliers to yield estimates of wealth among the living does not substantially change the degree of concentration over much of the period both in the {UK} and {US}, allowing inferences to be made for years when this method cannot be applied. The results show that wealth concentration in the {UK} remained relatively constant during the first wave of globalization, but then decreased dramatically in the period from 1914 to 1979. The {UK} went from being more unequal in terms of wealth than the {US} to being less unequal. However, the decline in {UK} wealth concentration came to an end around 1980, and since then there is evidence of an increase in top shares, notably in the distribution of wealth excluding housing in recent years.

The results suggest that the decline in the personal saving rate since 1984 is largely due to the significant capital gains in corporate equities experienced over this period. Over 5-year periods, the effect of capital gains in corporate equities on saving is substantially larger than the effect of capital gains in housing or other assets. Failure to differentiate wealth effects across asset types results in a significant understatement of their size.},

Since house prices fluctuate considerably over time, it is important to understand how these fluctuations affect households' consumption decisions. Rising house prices may stimulate consumption by increasing households' perceived wealth, or by relaxing borrowing constraints. This paper investigates the response of household consumption to house prices using {UK} micro data. We estimate the largest effect of house prices on consumption for older homeowners, and the smallest effect, insignificantly different from zero, for younger renters. This finding is consistent with heterogeneity in the wealth effect across these groups. In addition, we find that regional house prices affect regional consumption growth. Predictable changes in house prices are correlated with predictable changes in consumption, particularly for households that are more likely to be borrowing constrained, but this effect is driven by national rather than regional house prices and is important for renters as well as homeowners, suggesting that {UK} house prices are correlated with aggregate financial market conditions. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Using detailed Norwegian registry data, we document that after controlling for wealth, households with higher leverage respond more to wealth changes. Hence, for the purpose of understanding household consumption dynamics, total wealth is an insufficient statistic to summarize household balance sheets. We therefore develop a structural model that can account for mortgage debt over the life cycle and its relation to consumption choice. In our model, households hold debt, financial assets and illiquid housing. The marginal propensity to consume out of wealth is declining, as in a standard single-asset consumption model, but not monotonically: households who have recently bought houses have high leverage and high marginal propensity to consume. Our estimated model successfully targets the life cycle profiles of household balance sheets in the micro data. As a test of external validity, we show that regressions from data simulated by the model give results consistent with regressions on the actual registry data. Our findings corroborate the view that household indebtedness and leverage matter for consumption dynamics, that a substantial fraction of households are likely to behave in a hand-to-mouth fashion even though their wealth is high, and that the housing market is key to these phenomena.},

The analysis uses household asset and debt data for a sample of under age 65 home-owning households from the 1984 and 1989 waves of the {PSID} to construct changes in real household wealth as a measure of household saving behavior. Cross-time and cross-regional variation in housing market conditions are used to identify behavioral savings effects. The empirical analysis suggests that the estimated marginal propensity to consume out of real housing capital gains is 0.03 for the median saver household. However, there is an asymmetry in the saving response to both total and unanticipated real housing capital gains. All the savings offset comes from households that experience real housing capital losses. Households that experience real gains do not change their saving behavior. The existence of this asymmetry casts doubt on the power of changes in house prices to explain the time-series path of saving in the United States.},

We exploit cross-state variation in housing, stock wealth and other variables in a newly assembled panel data set and find that the impact of housing on consumer spending depends crucially on age composition, poverty rates, and the housing wealth share. In particular, young people who are more likely to be credit-constrained, and older homeowners, likely to be “trading down” on their housing stock, experience the largest housing wealth effects, as suggested by theory. Also, as suggested by theory, housing wealth effects are higher in state-years with higher housing wealth shares, and in state-years with higher poverty rates (likely reflecting the greater importance of credit constraints for those observations). Taking these various factors into account implies huge variation over time and across states in the size of housing wealth effects.},

While all household groups decreased their consumption ratios immediately in response to the financial crisis, net savers have increased their consumption ratios to pre-crisis levels again. Net borrowers, in particular those with high gross debt, have increased their speed of consolidation further during recent years. This indicates that household balance-sheet adjustment is a relatively long process, which has extended into the beginning of the recent economic upturn. Further, we estimate the marginal propensity to consume ({MPC}) out of increasing housing wealth over one year to be around 4-6 per cent. Younger and more levered households have a larger {MPC} out of housing wealth, suggesting that collateral effects may play a role. The {MPC} is asymmetric; households adjust their consumption more in response to negative housing wealth shocks than to positive. Finally, we simulate an increase in interest rates at the household level, and find that the impact of the implied changes in liquidity on overall consumption is modest. However, the interest-rate sensitivity is considerably higher for at-risk groups, such as households with large debt and adjustable-rate mortgages.},

	abstract = {Fluctuations in the stock market and in house values over the course of recent years have led to renewed macroeconomic policy debate as regards the effects of financial and housing wealth in the determination of consumer spending. This research assembles a unique matched sample of household data from the Survey of Consumer Finance and the Consumer Expenditure Survey to estimate the consumption effects of financial and housing wealth. The micro-data permit numerous innovations in the assessment of wealth effects, including an analysis of the impact of wealth on both durable and non-durable consumption and a comparison of wealth effects as derive from gross versus after-debt measures of financial and housing wealth. Further, the research seeks to assess robustness of those estimates to deviations from trend and volatility in financial and housing wealth and among credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Overall, research findings indicate relatively large housing wealth effects. Among homeowners, the housing wealth elasticities are estimated in the range of .06 over the 1989-2001 period. In marked contrast, the estimated elasticities of consumption spending with respect to financial wealth are smaller in magnitude and are in the range of .02. Further, the estimated wealth elasticities appear robust to deviations from trend and volatility in the wealth measures. Research findings support the hypothesized behavioral distinction in household consumption spending across durable versus non-durable categories. Consumption propensities also diverge sharply across the credit constrained and non-credit constrained households. Finally, there is little difference in wealth elasticities derived from measures of home equity versus house values. Research findings suggest the possibility of sizable reverse wealth effects. For example, a 10 percent decline in housing wealth from 2005 levels translates into a 1 percentage point decline in real {GDP} growth, a sizable reduction relative to the approximate 4 percent real {GDP} growth evidenced in prior years. Results of the analysis point to the sizable economy-wide risks associated with the recent retrenchment in house values. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Total credit has increased strongly relative to output and money in the second half of the twentieth century. Monetary policy responses to financial crises have also been more aggressive, but the output costs of crises have remained large. Credit growth is a powerful predictor of financial crises, suggesting that policymakers ignore credit at their peril. ({JEL} E32, E44, E52, G01, N10, N20)},

The household-level data allow us to study the joint distributions of household income and wealth since 1949. We expose the central importance of portfolio composition and asset prices for wealth dynamics in postwar America. Asset prices shift the wealth distribution because the composition and leverage of hfile:///C:/Users/Ruben/Dropbox/01\_PhD/Literature/Inequality and housing market/Kuhn, Schularick, Steins 2018 - Income and Wealth Inequality in America, 1949-2016.pdfousehold portfolios differ systematically along the wealth distribution. Middle-class portfolios are dominated by housing, while rich households predominantly own equity. An important consequence is that the top and the middle of the distribution are affected differentially by changes in equity and house prices. Housing booms lead to substantial wealth gains for leveraged middle-class households and tend to decrease wealth inequality, all else equal. Stock market booms primarily boost the wealth of households at the top of the distribution. This race between the equity market and the housing market shaped wealth dynamics in postwar America and decoupled the income and wealth distribution over extended periods. The historical data also reveal that no progress has been made in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households over the past 70 years, and that close to half of all American households have less wealth today in real terms than the median household had in 1970. {JEL}: D31, E21, E44, N32 for their helpful comments and suggestions.

However, this statement has not been empirically tested as of yet. The paper uses the Johansen procedure to estimate a long run relationship between mortgage credit and housing prices between1984 and 2012 and analyzes the interactions between the variables. To this effect, two models with two different housing price variables are estimated. It is found that mortgage credit is weakly exogenous. Impulse-response functions, variance decompositions and out of sample forecast also show that mortgage credit drives housing prices and not vice versa. The paper also looks at the effect of short-term and long-term interest rates and does not find important influences of both on housing prices or mortgage credit. The role of monetary policy is not likely to have been very strong in the built-up of the housing bubble.},

This approach enables us to tackle the heterogeneity in this market by modelling the individual behaviour and interactions of first-time buyers, home owners, buy-to-let investors, and renters from the bottom up, and observe the resulting aggregate dynamics in the property and credit markets. The model is calibrated using a large selection of micro-data, mostly from household surveys and housing market data sources. We perform a series of comparative statics exercises to investigate the impact of the size of the rental/buy-to-let sector and different types of buy-to-let investors on housing booms and busts. The results suggest that an increase in the size of the buy-to-let sector may amplify house price cycles and increase house price volatility. Furthermore, in order to illustrate the effects of macroprudential policies on several housing market indicators, we implement a loan-to-income portfolio limit. We find that this policy attenuates the house price cycle.},

Based on an analysis of advanced economies over the past three decades, we find that housing busts and recessions preceded by larger run-ups in household debt tend to be more severe and protracted.

Based on case studies, we find that government policies can help prevent prolonged contractions in economic activity{\textbackslash}nby addressing the problem of excessive household debt. In particular, bold household debt restructuring programs such as those implemented in the United States in the 1930s and in Iceland today can significantly reduce debt repayment burdens and the number of household defaults and foreclosures. Such policies can therefore help avert self-reinforcing cycles of household defaults, further house price declines, and additional contractions in output.},

	abstract = {The Great Recession that followed the financial crisis of 2007 is not only the largest economic crisis after the Great Depression of the 1930s, it also signals a crisis of economics as a discipline. This is not only the consequence of the inadequacy of mainstream macroeconomics, and specifically the {DSGE} workhorse model, to forecast such a huge event, or at least to detect the worrying tendencies towards it. Even more relevant is the choice to explicitly avoid the modelling of large crises (that for someone is a motivation for not attacking pre-crisis {DSGE} models focused on the analysis of small deviations from the steady-state), so denying the intrinsic nature of capitalism, a system that necessarily proceeds through cycles and (extended) crises. The replies of the {DSGE} approach to critics have led to extensions regarding for instance the role of financial frictions, heterogeneous agents, and bounded rationality (though typically in the form of quasi-rational expectations). The alternative paradigm of Agent-Based Macroeconomics can take into account all these elements at once within an evolutionary modelling framework based on heterogeneity and interaction, so capable to endogenously reproduce complex dynamics, from small fluctuations to large crises, due to innovation and industrial dynamics, rising inequality and financial instability, and so on. The integration between Agent-Based Macroeconomics and the (post-Keynesian) Stock-Flow Consistent approach represents a promising way for the future development of this research field.},

We show that the resulting debt-financed consumption boom jeopardises the stability of the economic system, thus paving the way for a financial crisis. Our model includes a behavioural rule for consumption based on expenditure cascades, a hierarchical structure of household finance, an articulated credit market with collateralised consumption loans and mortgages and a simple housing market. Results show that the model is able to capture the economic and social pressure of inequality on low and middle income households that pushes them to increase their consumption via home equity extraction. Rising non-performing loans lead to higher bad debt on the banks’ balance sheets and, consequently, to the emergence of a crisis as an endogenous dynamic.},

We resolve this longstanding question using new empirical methods applied to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Survey of Consumer Finances, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We find a strong positive relationship between saving rates and lifetime income and a weaker but still positive relationship between the marginal propensity to save and lifetime income. There is little support for theories that seek to explain these positive correlations by relying solely on time preference rates, nonhomothetic preferences, or variations in Social Security benefits. There is more support for models emphasizing uncertainty with respect to income and health expenses, bequest motives, and asset-based means testing or behavioral factors causing minimal saving rates among low-income households.},

The models incorporate income growth expectations, income uncertainty, housing collateral, and other credit effects. These models therefore capture important parts of the financial accelerator. The evidence is that credit availability for U.K. and U.S., but not Japanese, households has undergone large shifts since 1980. The average consumption‐to‐income ratio rose in the U.K. and U.S. as mortgage down‐payment constraints eased and as the collateral role of housing wealth was enhanced by financial innovations, such as home equity loans. The estimated housing collateral effect is similar in the U.S. and U.K. In Japan, land prices (which proxy house prices) continue to negatively impact consumer spending.

Results: The urodynamic study was abnormal in 84\% of the patients. The bladder was hypersensitive in 39\% and hyposensitive in 30\% of the cases, and maximum vesical capacity was greater than 600 ml. in 33\%. An acontractile detrusor was noted in 6\% of the patients, while 4\% had detrusor hyperreflexia and 35\% had bladder outlet obstruction. Conclusions: A high frequency of vesical alterations was observed, which were modified by association of progressive vesical dysfunction and diabetes mellitus. In diabetes mellitus dialysis protects against detrusor hypocontractility but predisposes the patients to have bladder obstruction.},

We find evidence of well specified consumption and house price functions and that Germany differs greatly from the Anglo-Saxon economies: rising house prices do not translate into higher consumer spending. This suggests that the transmission of monetary policy via asset prices, in particular house prices, on consumption is likely to be less effective, and any financial accelerator weaker, in Germany than in the {US} or the {UK}.

	volume = {811},
	abstract = {The failure of the ubiquitous New Keynesian “‟Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium‟ ({NK}-{DSGE}) models to capture interactions of finance and the real economy is widely-recognized since the 2008-9 financial crisis. {NK}-{DSGE} models exclude money, debt and asset prices and, importantly, ignore changing credit markets. These problems stem from assuming unrealistic micro-foundations for household behaviour, and that aggregate behaviour mimics a fully-informed „representative agent‟ (both assumptions are embodied in the underlying „rational expectations permanent income‟ hypothesis ({REPIH})). This survey critiques the {NK}-{DSGE} models and its integral {REPIH} model, and discusses alternative post-crisis general equilibrium models which do incorporate debt and allow crises to occur. But neither model type can be directly applied to policy-making. The survey reviews misspecifications in standard non-{DSGE} macro-models used by central banks (e.g. the Fed.‟s {FRB}-{US}), and related co-integration literature linking consumption with household portfolios. These too omit most of the „financial accelerator‟, ignoring credit shifts and crucially, aggregating liquid, illiquid assets, debt and housing into a single „net worth‟ construct. The survey‟s second focus is to improve non-{DSGE} models for policy using the Latent Interactive Variable Equation System ({LIVES}) approach, in which aggregate consumption is jointly modelled with the main elements of household balance sheets, extracting credit conditions as a latent variable. Empirical work on aggregate data is surveyed revealing the important role of debt and financial assets and the time and context-dependent role of housing collateral. Rather than „one-size-fits-all‟ monetary and macro-prudential policy, institutional differences between countries then imply major differences for monetary policy transmission and policy.},

The presence of similar channels in Canada would have important implications for monetary policy transmission. We trace the impact of shifts in non-price household credit conditions through joint estimation of a system of error-correction equations for Canadian aggregate consumption, house prices and mortgage debt. We find strong evidence that, after controlling for income and household portfolios, easier credit conditions raise house prices, debt and consumption. However, unlike in the United States, housing collateral effects on consumption are absent. Given credit conditions, rising house prices increase the mortgage down-payment requirement and reduce consumption, although there is evidence for some attenuation of this effect over the 2000s. We also find that high and rising levels of both house prices and debt since the late-1990s can be mostly explained by movements in incomes, housing supply, mortgage interest rates and credit conditions, suggesting that the outlook for house prices and debt could depend mainly on the future paths of these variables.},

	abstract = {It is a well-known fact that the housing market, with its associated mortgage securities, plays a crucial role in modern economies. The recent crisis of 2007, triggered by the U.S. real estate bubble, confirms this key role and suggests the importance of regulating mortgage lending. This paper investigates these issues by designing a housing market with a linked mortgage lending instrument in the Eurace agentbased model. Our results show that the presence of a housing market in the model has relevant macroeconomic implications, driven mainly by the additional amount of endogenous money injected into the economy by new mortgages. This additional money generally helps to support and stabilize aggregated demand, thus improving the main economic indicators. However, if the regulation of mortgage lending is too lax, involving an increase in the debt-service-to-income ratio ({DSTI}), then the additional supply of mortgages no longer enhances macroeconomic performance, and the stability of the economic system is undermined. Based on a number of recent discussions, a regulation of stock control that targets households’ net wealth (a stock), rather than income (a flow) is designed and analyzed. The results show that regulation of stock control can be combined effectively with {DSTI} to increase the stability of the housing market and the economy as a whole. Interestingly, the regulation based on stock control also directly affects mortgage distribution among households, avoiding excessive concentration. From a policy perspective, our results suggest that the use of a mild flow control regulation, coupled with a stricter stock control measure, fosters sustainable growth and eases first-time buyers access to the housing market, encouraging homeownership.},

Based on this unique data set, we put forward a stress testing method of household balance sheets in a consistent manner across euro area countries. To this end, we put forward a metric of distress which takes into account both the solvency and liquidity position of the household and demonstrate that this metric outperforms the most common metrics used in the literature, which do not take into account the households’ asset holdings. We calibrate this metric using the country level data on non-performing loan ratios and estimate stress-test elasticities in response to an interest rate shock, an income shock and a house price shock. We find that, albeit euro-area households are relatively resilient as a whole, there are large discrepancies in the impact of macroeconomic shocks across countries. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework could be used to assess some measures mitigating losses to the banks, such as engaging in the restructurings of loans that are at risk of defaulting.},

Using these data, we first confirm that loan-targeted instruments have a significant impact on household credit, and a milder, dampening effect on consumption. Next, we exploit novel numerical information on loan-to-value ({LTV}) limits using a propensity-score-based method to address endogeneity concerns. The results point to economically significant and nonlinear effects, with a declining impact for larger tightening measures. Moreover, the initial {LTV} level appears to matter; when {LTV} limits are already tight, the effects of additional tightening on credit is dampened while those on consumption are strengthened. {JEL} Classification Numbers: E58, G28},

To what extent have large declines in house prices driven household consumption after the crisis? What are the underlying channels at work? These are the key questions of this paper. On the macro level the drop in consumption of households who have negative home equity has the biggest impact on macro consumption, because their number sharply increased during the crisis. Precautionary savings motives appear to contribute most to the decline. Abstract To what extent do large drops in house prices drive household consumption? Using a large panel of Dutch households over the period 2007 to 2014, when house price dropped 27\%, we find a significantly positive relationship between house prices and household (durable) consumption. A 10\% change in home values leads to a 0.7\% change in household consumption for homeowners, but a negligible response for renters. Young and middle-aged homeowners have larger consumption sensitivities to house prices than old households. Delving into the underlying channels, a pure wealth effect can explain part of the consumption sensitivity to house prices. Furthermore , we find strong evidence that house prices affect consumption through the borrowing collateral (and precautionary saving) channel. for their helpful comments.

	abstract = {The effect of wealth on consumption is an issue of long-standing interest to economists. Conventional wisdom suggests that fluctuations in household wealth have driven major swings in economic activity both in the United States and abroad. This paper considers the so-called consumption wealth effects. There is an extensive existing literature on wealth effects that has yielded some insights. For example, research has documented the relationship between aggregate household wealth and aggregate consumption over time, and a large number of household-level studies suggest that wealth effects are larger for households facing credit constraints. However, there are also many unresolved issues regarding the influence of household wealth on consumption. We review the most important of these issues and argue that there is a need for much more research in these areas as well as better data sources for conducting such analysis.},

An innovation to improve on the flawed but widespread use of loan-to-value measures, is to estimate difficult-to-observe variations in loan quality and access to refinancing, and shifts in lenders' forbearance policy, by common latent variables in a system of equations for arrears and repossessions. We introduce, for the first time in the literature, a theory-justified estimate of the proportion of mortgages in negative equity as a key driver of aggregate repossessions and arrears. This is based on an average debt-equity ratio, corrected for regional deviations, and uses a functional form for the distribution of the debt-equity ratio checked on Irish micro-data from the Bank of Ireland, and Bank of England snapshots of negative equity. We systematically address serious measurement bias in the 'months-in-arrears' measures, neglected in previous {UK} studies. Highly significant effects on aggregate rates of repossessions and arrears are found for the aggregate debt-service ratio, the proportion of mortgages in negative equity and the unemployment rate. Economic forecast scenarios to 2020 highlight risks faced by the {UK} and its mortgage lenders, illustrating the usefulness of the approach for bank stress-testing. For macroeconomics, our model traces an important part of the financial accelerator: the feedback from the housing market to bad loans and hence banks' ability to extend credit.},

According to the second, a household is defined vulnerable if the sum of its income and liquid financial assets is not sufficient to cover debt payments and basic living costs for four months. While providing similar information on the proportion of households deemed vulnerable, the two indicators capture different aspects of the sector’s financial fragility: vulnerable households according to the first indicator have, on average, higher income, liquid assets and debt than those identified by the second indicator. Moreover, while the first indicator shows a lower correlation with payment arrears, its simplicity, timeliness and less arbitrary components make it better suited for cross-country comparisons.},

Die erhobenen Daten fließen in geld- und finanzstabilitätspolitische Untersuchungen ein und bilden die Grundlage für Forschungsprojekte und Analysen innerhalb und außerhalb der Bundesbank. An der Befragung im Jahr 2017 beteiligten sich fast 5 000 Haushalte. Rund zwei Drittel nahmen bereits zum zweiten oder dritten Mal teil. Die Ergebnisse für das Jahr 2017 zeigen, dass die Vermögen der privaten Haushalte zwischen 2014 und 2017 auf breiter Basis zunahmen. Sowohl das durchschnittliche Nettovermögen als auch der Median sind deutlich angestiegen. Insbesondere die Nettovermögen von Immobilieneigentümern haben sich in Folge der gestiegenen Immobilienpreise erhöht. Aber auch die Vermögen vieler Mieterhaushalte und von Haushalten in der vermögensärmeren Hälfte der Verteilung sind angestiegen. Zur positiven Vermögensentwicklung dieser Haushalte tragen insbesondere die gestiegenen Einkommen bei. Sie versetzen diese Haushalte in die Lage, mehr zu sparen und verringern die Notwendigkeit, neue Konsumentenkredite aufzunehmen. Zwar gingen gegenüber der letzten Erhebung einige Kennziffern für die Ungleichheit der Vermögensverteilung leicht zurück, insgesamt lässt sich im Vergleich zu den bisherigen Befragungen aber kein eindeutiger Trend erkennen. Der Anteil der verschuldeten Haushalte und der Anteil der Haushalte mit negativem Nettovermögen veränderten sich zwischen 2010 und 2017 nur marginal. Die Belastung der Haushalte durch Kreditzinsen ging im gleichen Zeitraum zurück. Die verschuldeten Haushalte wendeten im Jahr 2017 einen deutlich geringeren Teil ihres Einkommens für Kreditzinsen auf als im Jahr 2010. Dieser Aufsatz beschreibt, wie sich Vermögen und Schulden privater Haushalte in Deutschland zusammensetzen und verteilen. Für eine umfassendere Beurteilung der finanziellen Lage oder gar des Wohlergehens der Haushalte spielen auch andere Faktoren, wie die öffentlichen Finanzen, die staatliche Alterssicherung, der Zugang zu Bildung oder dem Gesundheitssystem und vieles mehr eine Rolle.},

We find default increasing with originating loan-to-value and falling in the origination debt service ratio. A non-linear cubic spline model is used to identify threshold effects and we identify clear turning points in these relationships. This analysis could provide one input into supervisory considerations when setting limits in a macro prudential context.

Policy tools to address this risk, such as caps on loan-to-value ({LTV}) and loan-to-income ({LTI}) ratios should by design reflect the risk profile of lending. This research considers the heterogeneity of default risk between first time buyers and second and subsequent buyers and finds that first time buyers have lower default rates having controlled for borrower and loan characteristics. The potential implications for the macro prudential policy setting are empirically analysed: the default-differential between the two groups linearly increases with {LTI} and a non-linear difference is found to be maximised at 80-85 per cent for {LTV}. In addition, the role for a rule designed on house valuation is examined, with results showing a diminishing default-differential as valuations increase. This research is consistent with differential regulatory treatment of first time buyers with default risk remaining comparable to the remainder of mortgage lending.},

The results suggest that mortgages with government-loan-guarantees perform better.

We find a robust negative link between skewness and {GDP} growth in a large sample of countries over 1960–2000. This suggests a positive effect of systemic risk on growth. To explain this finding, we present a model in which contract enforceability problems generate borrowing constraints and impede growth. In financially liberalized economies with moderate contract enforceability, systemic risk taking is encouraged and increases investment. This leads to higher mean growth but also to greater incidence of crises. In the data, the link between skewness and growth is indeed strongest in such economies},

	abstract = {This paper explores the interaction between monetary policy and prudential regulation in an agent-based modeling framework. Firms borrow funds from the banking system in an economy regulated by a central bank. The central bank carries out monetary policy, by setting the interest rate, and prudential regulation, by establishing the banking capital requirement. Different combinations of interest rate rule and capital requirement rule are evaluated with respect to both macroeconomic and financial stability. Several relevant policy implications were drawn. First, the efficacy of a given capital requirement rule or interest rate rule depends on the specification of the rule of the other type it is combined with. More precisely, less aggressive interest rate rules perform better when the range of variation of the capital requirement is narrower. Second, interest rate smoothing is more effective than the other interest rate rules assessed, as it outperforms those other rules with respect to financial stability and macroeconomic stability. Third, there is no tradeoff between financial and macroeconomic stability associated with a variation of either the capital requirement or the smoothing interest rate parameter. Finally, our results reinforce the cautionary finding of other studies regarding how output can be ravaged by a low inflation targeting.},

	title = {Elements of Effective Macroprudential Policies Lessons from International Experience},
	abstract = {Experience with macroprudential policy is growing. A large number of countries have put in place dedicated institutional arrangements. Progress is being made also with the design and implementation of macroprudential tools, and an increasing body of empirical research is available that evaluates the effectiveness of macroprudential policy.Responding to an existing G20 mandate1, this joint work takes stock of the experiences gained so far regarding elements and practices that can be useful for effective macroprudential policy making. It builds on the 2011 joint progress report to the G20 on macroprudential policy tools and frameworks ({FSB}/{IMF}/{BIS} 2011) and other {IMF}2, {FSB}3 and {BIS}4 documents, taking into account more recent country and international institutions’ experience as well as empirical evidence from academic and other studies.While macroprudential policy tools have been in use in a number of emerging market economies well before the global financial crisis, their broader use is more recent and the establishment of dedicated macroprudential policy frameworks has often been prompted by the crisis experience. Accordingly, the experience gained in many countries does not yet span a full financial cycle, and lessons and empirical evidence based on that experience remaintentative. The wide range of institutional arrangements and policies being adopted across countries suggests that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach. Nonetheless, accumulated experience highlights – and this paper documents – a number of elements that have been found useful for macroprudential policy making.The remainder of this document is structured as follows. Section I discusses the definition, objectives, and scope of macroprudential policy. Section {II} covers institutional arrangements, including mandates and governance, powers, and arrangements for domestic cooperation.},

	title = {Distributional effects of monetary policy},
	issn = {0160-0176},
	abstract = {In the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis, central banks worldwide reduced their policy rates to historical lows and took recourse to a range of unconventional policy measures, especially purchase programmes. Amongst other things, this has sparked a heated debate over whether and in what way monetary policy affects the distribution of income and wealth. Whereas the task of the Eurosystem’s monetary policy is to maintain price stability and the political mandate for redistribution lies with fiscal policymakers, it is nevertheless important that monetary policymakers, too, analyse distributional effects in greater depth to gain a better understanding of the potential interaction between monetary policy and distribution to help them perform their monetary policy mandate in the best possible way. Much of the corresponding research on these issues is still in its infancy, and the findings depend to a large extent on the underlying models and assumptions. Caution is therefore warranted when interpreting the results. However, outlined below are a number of conclusions that can already be made as things stand today. Contrary to earlier assumptions, monetary policy may, too, possibly exhibit distributional effects over the economic cycle, albeit comparatively weak ones. In conventional monetary policy mode, policy rate cuts may cause a slight reduction in distributional inequality; however, the reduction is marginal and relatively insignificant in terms of distributional developments over the past few decades. The much-touted view that non-standard monetary policy measures demonstrably increased inequality cannot be corroborated. It is derived from analyses which are based on an inadmissible generalisation, neglect lagged distributional effects and fail to select the correct reference scenario. Against the backdrop of existing studies and taking into account the three aspects mentioned above, it appears very doubtful, to put it mildly, that the expansionary non-standard monetary policy measures in recent years have caused inequality to increase overall. This particularly holds true for the distribution of income. Viewed in isolation, conventional interest rate policy and nonstandard measures have probably, if anything, reduced income inequality. By contrast, the way in which these policies and measures have affected wealth distribution is less evident.},

This paper analyzes the housing markets in 114 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States from 1990 to 2002, treats both prices and volume as endogenous variables, and studies whether and how exogenous shocks cause co-movements of prices and volume. At quarterly frequency, we find that, first, both home prices and trading volume are affected by conditions in labor markets, the mortgage market, and the stock market, and the effects differ between markets with low and high supply elasticity. Second, home prices Granger cause trading volume, but the effects are asymmetric-decreases in prices reduce trading volume, and increases in prices have no effect. Third, trading volume also Granger causes home prices, but only in markets with inelastic supply. Finally, we find a statistically significant positive price-volume correlation; which, however, is mainly explained by co-movements of prices and volume caused by exogenous shocks, instead of the Granger causality between prices and volume. © Springer Science+Business Media, {LLC} 2008.},

This is at odds with a prominent theoretical view which, using the logic of the permanent income hypothesis, argues that consumption responses should be small. We show that, in contrast to this view, workhorse models of consumption with incomplete markets calibrated to rich cross-sectional micro facts actually predict large consumption responses, in line with the data. To explain this result, we show that consumption responses to permanent house price shocks can be approximated by a simple and robust rule-of-thumb formula: the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income times the value of housing. In our model, consumption responses depend on a number of factors such as the level and distribution of debt, the size and history of house price shocks, and the level of credit supply. Each of these effects is naturally explained with our simple formula.},

This paper aims to tilt this imbalance towards heterogeneous agents setups by surveying the main positive and normative findings of this line of the literature, and suggesting areas in which these models could be implemented. In particular, we review studies that analyse the heterogeneity of (i) households' income, (ii) households' preferences, (iii) consumers' age, (iv) expectations and (v) firms' productivity and financial position.

By introducing endogenous growth, this model is able to capture the persistent effect of financial crises on output, which is different from previous literature but consistent with the data.

In a calibrated version of the baseline model, I find that the impact of the optimal macroprudential policy on growth and welfare is quantitatively small even if it significantly increases financial stability. I consider two extensions of the model in which the optimal macroprudential policy has a larger impact on growth and welfare: one in which macroprudential policy is jointly used with a growth subsidy that helps reduce the cost of financial crises; and another extension with a direct growth externality.},

Despite the extreme importance of incorporating financial constraints in Real Business Cycle ({RBC}) models, the resulting {DSGE}-3D construct still embraces the representative agent idea, making serious analyses of diversity of economic entities impossible. In this paper, we present an alternative to {DSGE} modelling that seriously departs from the assumption of the representativeness of agents. Within an Agent Based Modelling ({ABM}) framework, we build an environment suitable for performing counterfactual simulations of the impact of macroprudential policy on the economy, financial system and society.

Here we test the validity of the ergodic hypothesis in an established model of wealth in a growing economy with reallocation. We fit model parameters to historical data from the United States. In recent decades, we find negative reallocation rates, i.e. from poorer to richer, for which no stationary distribution exists. When we find positive reallocation, convergence to the stationary distribution is too slow for the distribution to be practically relevant. Inequality evolves because the distribution is inherently unstable on human timescales, irrespective of shocks. Our analysis is informative of net reallocation in the United States economy. It does not support use of the ergodic hypothesis in this model for these data. Studies of other models and data, in which the hypothesis is made, would benefit from similar tests.},

We find that banks mainly responded to credit restrictions by making adjustments to the liability side of their balance sheets, particularly by increasing the proportion of long-term funding. Responses on the asset side were limited, while part of the banking sector even increased lending after the installment of a restriction. These results suggest that banks and financial institutions responded by switching to long-term funding to meet the restriction and shield their lending business.

In this essay, we review the literature that does exist on wealth accumulation and distribution. We begin with an examination of the reasons that wealth inequality has received little empirical attention. We then discuss methods of creating empirical estimates of wealth accumulation and distribution, and we present some estimates of recent trends in wealth inequality. We explore a diverse collection of research that explains these trends, covering treatments of aggregate influences and individual and household factors. We conclude the chapter with a review of research on intergenerational processes and wealth mobility. Copyright © 2000 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.},

	volume = {138},
	abstract = {Following the global financial crisis, many countries have introduced or tightened macroprudential policies. Using an agent- based model ({ABM}), this paper seeks to measure the impact on house price cycles of two distinct borrower-based macroprudential instruments, namely loan-to-income and loan- to-value ratios. The use of an {ABM} allows for the consideration of the effects of these poli- cies on the distribution of heterogeneous households. The paper shows that the relation between tightening an instrument and its ef- fect on house price fluctuations may be highly non-linear, depending on the distribution of households for which the instrument becomes binding. Furthermore, the paper demon- strates that the marginal effect of tightening one instrument generally depends on the cali- bration of the other instrument. From a policy perspective, these findings highlight the im- portance of using granular data – preferably at the household level – when calibrating bor- rower-based macroprudential instruments. Likewise, the findings demonstrate the im- portance of macroprudential authorities es- tablishing a coherent framework where the effects of different measures are evaluated together},

We provide a systematic transmission mechanism by focusing on the flows of resources between borrowers and lenders, i.e. new borrowing and debt service. We construct the first cross-country dataset of these flows for a panel of household debt in 16 countries. We show that new borrowing increases economic activity but generates a pre-specified path of debt service that reduces future economic activity. The protracted response in debt service derives from two key analytic properties of credit booms: (i) new borrowing is auto-correlated and (ii) debt contracts are long term. We confirm these properties in the data and show that debt service peaks on average four years after credit booms and is associated with significantly lower output and higher crisis risk. Our results explain the transmission mechanism through which credit booms and busts generate non-monotonic and long-lasting aggregate demand effects and are, hence, crucial for macroeconomic stabilization policy.},

The impacts on housing markets and housing policies are considered and it is shown that these are more significant in dynamic than in static systems.

	abstract = {A significant amount of the increase in the wealth income ratio in recent decades is due to an increase in the value of land. We present a series of models that explain why land prices may have increased. These models help us understand the increase in both the wealth income ratio and wealth inequality. One model focuses on certain locations as being positional good. In another, we show that land bubbles are a natural part of market economies, and that on “bubble paths”, wealth may increase, even as the real wealth of the economy diminishes. Focusing on long run equilibrium, we show that a tax on the returns on land (including capital gains) can lead to higher incomes and less inequality. We show the links between the increases in land values and the financial system, demonstrating how changes in the rules governing that sector and the conduct of monetary policy may increase inequality. Given the large amount of life cycle savings, the traditional division of society into the owners of capital and workers or creditors and debtors may no longer provide the most insights for understanding the impact of policies on distribution. The relevant division is between capitalists, who pass on their wealth from generation to generation, and workers, and between the owners of equity and the holders of debt instruments. These distinctions are important for tax, financial and monetary policy. In our simple model, a lowering of interest rates benefits holders of equity— the capitalists—but hurts holders of government bonds, disproportionately life-cycle savers, and thus increases inequality. Similarly, a lowering of collateral requirements or of banks’ capital adequacy requirements does not result in an increase in the overall efficiency of the economy, but leads to more inequality.},

While low interest rates and rising bond prices have had a negligible impact on wealth inequality, rising equity prices have been a key driver of inequality. A recovery in house prices has only partly offset this effect. Abstracting from general equilibrium effects on savings, borrowing and human wealth, this suggests that monetary policy may have added to inequality to the extent that it has boosted equity prices. {JEL} classification: D31, E52.},

The capital gains from bond price and equity price increases turn out to be concentrated among relatively few households, while the median household strongly benefits from housing price increases. The capital gains from bond price increases (relative to household net wealth) do not correlate with household net wealth (or income). Bond price increases thus leave net wealth inequality largely unchanged. In contrast, equity price increases largely benefit the top end of the net wealth (and income) distribution, thus amplify net wealth inequality. Housing price increases display a hump shaped pattern over the net wealth distribution, with the poorest and richest households benefitting least, but there exists considerable heterogeneity across Euro Area countries. The {ECB}'s {OMT} announcements over the summer of 2012 had quantitatively similar distributional implications as an unexpected loosening of the policy rate by about 175 basis points.},

We use such framework to study a deleveraging shock, modeled as an increase in housing investment risk, that falls more strongly on, and produces a larger contraction in credit for high-{LTV} type borrowers, as in the data. We find that this deleveraging experience produces significant aggregate effects on output and consumption, and that the contractionary effects are orders of magnitudes higher in a model version that takes account of borrower heterogeneity, compared to a more standard model version with a representative borrower.},

Conditional on this model, we consider the implications of macroprudential policies that aim to lean against an excessive credit cycle. In particular, we allow macroprudential authorities to tighten excessive lending to higher leveraged households, whose riskiness had been evaluated too optimistically. We find that a policy that targets only the group of households that most strongly deleveraged after an adverse idiosyncratic housing investment risk shock, is welfare-improving at social and individual levels, relative to a macroprudential policy which targets all households in the economy.},

The new paradigm features multiple distributional channels of monetary policy. Most empirical studies, however, analyze each potential channel of redistribution in isolation. Our review suggests that empirical research on the effects of conventional monetary policy on income and wealth inequality yields mixed findings, although there seems to be a consensus that higher inflation, at least above some threshold, increases inequality. In contrast to common wisdom, conclusions concerning the impact of unconventional monetary policies on inequality are also not clear cut. To better understand policy effects on inequality, future research should focus on the estimation of General Equilibrium models with heterogeneous agents.},

Given that housing is the most important asset in household portfolios, relaxing or tightening access to mortgages may affect the distribution of household wealth in the country. In a stylised model we show that the final level of wealth inequality depends on the size of the {LTV} ratio, housing prices, credit cost and the strength of a bequest motive, and therefore it is not possible to predict an unequivocal effect of {LTV} ratios on wealth inequality. These trade-offs are illustrated with estimations of “Gini Recentered Influence Function” regressions on household survey data from 12 Euro-zone countries that participated in the first wave of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. The results show that, among the households with active mortgages, high {LTV} ratios at the time of acquisition are related to high contributions to wealth inequality today, while house price increases are negatively related to inequality contributions. A proxy for the strength of bequest motives tends to be negatively related with wealth inequality, but credit cost does not show a significant link to the distribution of wealth.},

This paper studies the implications of housing booms and busts for wealth inequality, examining two episodes over the last four decades in Spain. I combine multiple micro and macro data sources to reconstruct the wealth dis- tribution and develop a new asset-specific decomposition of wealth accumulation to disen- tangle the main forces behind wealth inequality dynamics. I find that the top 10\% wealth share drops during housing booms, but the decreasing pattern reverts during busts. Dif- ferences in capital gains across wealth groups appear to be the main drivers of the decline in wealth concentration during booms. In contrast, persistent differences in saving rates across wealth groups and portfolio reshuffling towards financial assets among top wealth holders are the main explanatory forces behind the reverting evolution during housing busts. I show that the heterogeneity in saving responses is largely driven by differences in portfolio adjustment frictions across wealth groups and that tax incentives can exacerbate this differential behavior. Using a novel personal income and wealth tax panel, I explore the role of tax incentives exploiting quasi-experimental variation created by a large capital income tax reform in a differences-in-differences setting. I find that capital income tax cuts, largely benefiting top wealth holders, explain on average 60\% of the increase in the top 10\% wealth share during the recent housing bust. These results provide novel empir- ical evidence to enrich macroeconomic theories of wealth inequality over the business cycle.},

One reason is the growing recognition that, in seeking explanations for rising income inequality, we need to look not only at wages and earned income but also at income from capital, particularly at the top of the distribution. In this paper, we use evidence from existing data sources to attempt to answer three questions: (i) What is the share of total personal wealth that is owned by the top 1 per cent, or the top 0.1 per cent? (ii) Is wealth much more unequally distributed than income? (iii) Is the concentration of wealth at the top increasing over time?

We find a large decline of the top 10\% wealth share from the 1910s to the 1980s (from 80-90\% of total wealth during the 19th century up until World War 1, down to 50-60\% in the 1980s), mostly to the benefit of the middle 40\% of the distribution (the bottom 50\% wealth share is always less than 10\%). Since the 1980s-90s, we observe a moderate rise of wealth concentration, with large fluctuations due to asset price movements. In effect, rising inequality in saving rates and rates of return pushes toward rising wealth concentration, in spite of the contradictory effect of housing prices. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how the combination of unequal saving rates, rates of return and labor earnings leads to large multiplicative effects and high steady-state wealth concentration. Small changes in the key parameters appear to matter a lot for long- run inequality. We discuss the conditions under which rising concentration is likely to continue in the coming decades.},

An important consequence is that the top and the middle of the distributionare affected differentially by changes in equity and house prices. Housing booms lead to substantialwealth gains for leveraged middle-class households and tend to decrease wealth inequality, all else equal.Stock market booms primarily boost the wealth of households at the top of the distribution. This racebetween the equity market and the housing market shaped wealth dynamics in postwar America anddecoupled the income and wealth distribution over extended periods. The historical data also revealthat no progress has been made in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and whitehouseholds over the past 70 years, and that close to half of all American households have less wealthtoday in real terms than the median household had in 1970.},

The sharp observed increases in earnings inequality, the falling labor share over the recentdecades, and potential mechanisms underlying changes in the gap between the interest rate and thegrowth rate (Piketty's r-g story) all fall far short of accounting for the data.},

risk. We formalize the connection between partial and general equilibrium effects, and show that

Frederic Mishkin is not only an academic expert in the field but also has been a high-level policymaker. He is especially well positioned to discuss the changes in the conduct of monetary policy in recent years, in particular the turn to inflation targeting. Monetary Policy Strategy describes his work over the last ten years, offering published papers, new introductory material, and a summing up, "Everything You Wanted to Know about Monetary Policy Strategy, But Were Afraid to Ask," which reflects on what we have learned about monetary policy over the last thirty years.Mishkin blends theory, empirical evidence, and extensive case studies of monetary policy in advanced and emerging market and transition economies. Throughout, his focus is on these key areas: the importance of price stability and a nominal anchor; fiscal and financial preconditions for achieving price stability; central bank independence as an additional precondition; central bank accountability; the rationale for inflation targeting; the optimal inflation target; central bank transparency and communication; and the role of asset prices in monetary policy.},

Our main finding is that contractionary monetary policy shocks increase income inequality, on average. The effect is asymmetric—tightening of policy raises inequality more than easing lowers it—and depends on the state of the business cycle. We find some evidence that the effect increases with the share of labor income and is mitigated by redistribution policies. Finally, while an unexpected increase in policy rates increases inequality, changes in policy rates driven by an increase in growth and inflation are associated with lower inequality.},

We consider two macro-prudential policy regimes, namely generic and sector-specific. We find that both regimes are more effective than the baseline regime (constant {LTV} ratios) in stabilising macroeconomic and financial stability, and welfare enhancing. Compared to the generic regime, the sector-specific regime delivers a higher degree of macroeconomic and financial stability. For both regimes there is a clear tradeoff between financial and macroeconomic stability, as the authority adjusts its preference between the two policy objectives. To enhance the effectiveness of the {CcLTV} regulation, we argue that the regulator should consider borrowers’ heterogeneity, and tailor the regulation according to the specific conditions of each sector of the credit market, rather than to the aggregate credit conditions.},

However, the effects of such measures on the core objectives of monetary policy to stabilise output and inflation are largely unknown. In this paper we quantify the effects of changes in maximum loan-to-value ({LTV}) ratios on output and inflation. We rely on a narrative identification approach based on detailed reading of policy-makers' objectives when implementing the measures. We find that over a four year horizon, a 10 percentage point decrease in the maximum {LTV} ratio leads to a 1.1\% reduction in output. As a rule of thumb, the impact of a 10 percentage point {LTV} tightening can be viewed as roughly comparable to that of a 25 basis point increase in the policy rate. However, the effects are imprecisely estimated and the effect is only present in emerging market economies. We also find that tightening {LTV} limits has larger economic effects than loosening them. At the same time, we show that changes in maximum {LTV} ratios have substantial effects on credit and house price growth. Using inverse propensity weights to rerandomise {LTV} actions, we show that these effects are likely causal.},

Using new data from the World Income Database ({WID}), this article examines how economic, political and institutional dynamics shape wealth-to-income ratios within Western European and {OECD} countries. It is found that the political and institutional determinants that affect income inequality have no short- or long-run effects on the wealth-to-income ratio. Rather, the rise in wealth-to-income ratios is driven by rising housing prices, as well as price changes in other financial assets, not home ownership or national saving rates. The article concludes by examining how the changing dynamics of housing prices and wealth inequality will increasingly shape intergenerational – and associated class-based – political conflict in Western Europe.},

The main conclusions are that (i) macroprudential policies have been quite effective in stabilising credit cycles. The propagation of the effects to credit growth is more rapid for policies aimed at curbing the cycle than for policies aimed at fostering resilience; and (ii) macroprudential tools have a greater effect on credit growth when reinforced by the use of monetary policy.},

This has led to a vigorous debate as to whether widening inequality was somehow to blame for the crisis by driving private sector credit booms. Despite growing interest, empirical evidence on an inequality–fragility relationship is limited. Based on a panel analysis of 18 {OECD} (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries for the years 1970–2007, this study provides evidence of a positive relationship between income concentration and private sector indebtedness, once other traditional drivers are controlled for. If confirmed, the implications of this result are as follows: (i) the view that the distribution of income is irrelevant to macroeconomic stability, as implicit in mainstream approaches, needs further investigation; and (ii) in order to make the financial system more robust, policy makers should cast the net wider than monetary policy and regulatory reforms and consider the effects of changes to distributive patterns.},

We show that macroprudential policy shocks have effects on real {GDP}, the price level and credit that are very similar to those of monetary policy shocks, but the detailed transmission of the two policies is different. Whereas macroprudential policy shocks mostly affect residential investment and household credit, monetary policy shocks have more widespread effects on the economy. Moreover, while positive credit shocks are generally met with tighter macroprudential policy, macro-financial country characteristics such as the exchange rate regime and the level of financial development affect the policy response.},

Asset prices shift the wealth distribution because of systematic differences in household portfolios along the wealth distribution. Middle-class portfolios are dominated by housing, while rich households predominantly own business equity. Differential changes in equity and house prices shaped wealth dynamics in postwar America and decoupled the income and wealth distribution over extended periods.},

The empirical analysis highlights that for the median level of the financial vulnerability index households already exhibit some important symptoms of financial vulnerability, such as problems in getting to the end of the month or an inability to face unexpected expenses. As regards the determinants of the financial vulnerability index, three findings need to be pointed out. First, the level of debt servicing is positively related to financial vulnerability and the effect is stronger for households holding unsecured debt, i.e. consumer credit. Second, financial vulnerability also increases for impulsive individuals, who may adopt impatient, short-sighted behaviour patterns which make it difficult for them to be fully aware of the consequences of their financial and spending decisions. Third, a higher level of education helps to reduce financial fragility.},

We first develop a financial vulnerability index to control for the risk to the household. We then examine the life cycle demand for life insurance using several definitions of life insurance. We find, in contrast to previous research, that there is a relationship between financial vulnerability and the amount of term life or total life insurance purchased. In addition, we find older consumers use less life insurance to protect a certain level of financial vulnerability than younger consumers. Secondly, our study provides evidence that life insurance demand is jointly determined as part of a household's portfolio. Finally, we consider the impact of family members' nonmonetary contribution on the household's life cycle protection decision. Our results provide some evidence that households take into account the value of nonmonetary contribution in their insurance purchase.},

Our findings show that individuals resort to the market economy to maintain a moral economy of credit which can be a blessing (when the extension of financial help to important others alleviates financial vulnerability by negotiating the marketplace) or a curse (when extension of financial help to others leads to one’s own financial constraints).

Consequently, the number of financially vulnerable households almost doubled. Design/methodology/approach Econometric model of discrete election. Findings The most vulnerable households – and therefore those with a higher risk of mortgage payment default – are those whose family head is a married and self-employed female. In contrast, in social housing the mortgaged households have been less vulnerable in the context of economic and financial crisis and unlike what would have been initially expected, higher education levels have not acted as a protective factor against households’ financial vulnerability.

Design/methodology/approach The authors use data from Household Finance and Consumption Survey, a quite novel data set that covers the whole balance sheet of a sample of households. The authors compute four indicators of debt burden and in order to study households’ risk of default the authors apply two-part model, which is a valuable alternative to the application of conventional regression models with zero-inflated data. Findings Analysis reveals that the burden of debts and the risk of default are very different among the four countries, in particular Spain and Portugal have the highest proportion of financially vulnerable households. Originality/value The study is one a few that have directly compared objectives indicators of households’ financial vulnerability in all Southern European countries. Moreover, the authors employ a two-part model, a valuable alternative to the application of conventional logit or linear regression models. In the first part of the model the authors estimate the probability that households suffer financial vulnerability; in the second part, the authors estimate households’ level of vulnerability only for vulnerable families.},

	abstract = {Household financial vulnerability has gained considerable attention since the global financial crisis and it concerns policymakers due to its impact on macroeconomic indicators of financial instability. However, financial vulnerability is a complex multi-dimensional concept and large gaps remain in the underpinning of a comprehensive financial vulnerability assessment at the micro level. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to assess financial vulnerability by employing an unsupervised machine learning technique. A two-step empirical strategy is used to conduct this analysis. First, Hierarchical Ascending Clustering ({HAC}) and K-means clustering analysis is undertaken to identify homogenous clusters of households, which are financially vulnerable. Afterwards, we estimate the probability of being financially vulnerable depending upon different household and geographical characteristics using a logistic regression. Data from the Survey of Consumer Finance ({SCF}) for the years 1998, 2007 and 2016 are used for this analysis. The empirical results show that about 28\% of the households in United States are financially vulnerable as of 2016, which is 4\% less as compared to 2007. The results of the econometric estimations highlight that Black and African Americans are 8\% and Hispanic Americans are 6\% more likely to be financially vulnerable than non-Hispanic white persons, after taking into account other household and regional level characteristics. Econometric estimations also highlight the existence of large gaps in household financial vulnerability across other household characteristics, such as education level, employment status, marital status, and age of the household head. Lastly, regional characteristics do not seem to have a significant impact on household’s financial vulnerability as long as the net-worth of the household is taken into account.},

Design/methodology/approach This research uses a dynamic latent class model (latent transition analysis) to explore the dynamics of consumers’ financial vulnerability over time using longitudinal data obtained by repeatedly administering a measure of financial vulnerability. Findings This research finds that consumers in a state of lower vulnerability are “fragile” in having a relatively high likelihood of moving to a state of higher vulnerability, whereas those in a state of higher vulnerability are “entrenched” in having a relatively low likelihood of moving to a state of lower vulnerability. This pattern of results is called the “financial vulnerability trap.” While financial self-efficacy explains state membership, the consideration of future consequences drives state transitions. Research limitations/implications Future research could follow consumers over a longer period and consider the role of alternative psychological characteristics besides those examined. Practical implications This research provides practitioners with actionable insights regarding the drivers of changes in consumers’ financial vulnerability across time, showing the value of financial self-efficacy and the consideration of future consequences when developing strategies to prevent consumers from sliding from a state of lower to higher financial vulnerability over time. Originality/value There is scant research on financial vulnerability. Further, prior research has not examined whether and how consumers’ psychological characteristics help explain their membership of and transitions between states of different levels of financial vulnerability over time.},

The {HFCS} allows us to investigate potential risks household debt may pose to financial stability. Following the recent literature on indebtedness, we look first at the intensive as well as extensive margin of credit. The data show that debt participation and the level of debt in general increases with wealth and income, which points toward a relatively low risk to the financial sector. Additionally, our analysis identifies vulnerable households and estimates the financial sector’s potential exposure at default and loss given default. We find that the estimates for loss given default range from 0.2\% to 10\% and are in line with similar studies for other countries. Combining these estimates with important other financial stability indicators, such as the development of initial loan-to-value ratios, we are able to conclude that at present, the risk to financial stability stemming from households in Austria is relatively low.},

We estimate this house price index based on directly observed object-level information provided by homeowners. This results not only in an accurate index of house price developments as shown in the seminal contribution of Kiel and Zabel (1999), but also allows us to analyze the full distribution of house prices and their changes beyond the mean. We compare our approach to the two other price indices available in Austria, which use hedonic regressions based on transaction or quotation prices, and discuss advantages and disadvantages of the available indices while focusing on our primary objective, analyzing implications for financial stability. We find that the fairly steep increase of house prices recently observed has been driven by a rather small segment of the market. Further results suggest that the observed long-term real estate price increases have been remarkably stable. At the heart of our contribution is an analysis of the impact of house price changes on the loss given default of vulnerable mortgage holders. We base this analysis on scenarios that incorporate the observed empirical distribution of house price changes and show that the risks to financial stability are relatively limited. We conclude with a summary of the findings and provide a general assessment of the Austrian housing market.},

In contrast, buffer-stock consumers set average consumption growth equal to average labor income growth, regardless of tastes. The model can explain three empirical puzzles: the “consumption/income parallel” documented by Carroll and Summers; the “consumption/income divergence” first documented in the 1930s; and the stability of the household age/wealth profile over time despite the unpredictability of idiosyncratic wealth changes.},

Instead, our results suggest that over most of their working life time, consumers behave in accordance with the ‘buffer-stock’ models of saving described in Carroll (1992, 1997) or Deaton (1991), in which consumers hold wealth principally to insulate consumption against near-term fluctuations in income.},

	abstract = {In the early 1990s the most severe recessions occurred in those countries which had experienced the largest increases in private debt burdens. Was this an accident of history or did it reflect deeper forces affecting market economies? The paper comprises three parts. First, it presents three ‘stylised facts’ about debt and its impact on consumption growth in the 1930s and the 1990s. Second, it discusses the reception of Irving Fisher's work on debt deflation by his contemporaries, and argues that it is helpful to think of debt deflation as a real business cycle phenomenon. Third, there is a theoretical discussion of the reaction of debt and consumption to shocks in the context of a model of precautionary saving. Central to the model is the role of distributional shocks which implies that aggregate demand may be a nonmonotonic function of the price of assets in terms of the consumption good. Multiple equilibria may exist, leading to the possibility of financial instability. The analysis of debt deflation requires the construction of real business cycle models without a representative consumer.},

The paper uses a unique quarterly panel dataset containing financial information on over 100 000 individuals. The dataset covers the period 2005–2011, when there were large changes in credit volumes, income and consumption in Estonia, a new {EU} member country. The estimations show that indebtedness measured by the debt-to-income ratio and the debt service ratio hampers consumption over the whole business cycle. The negative impact of the debt service ratio is, however, substantially stronger during the recession than in the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, while the negative effect of the debt-to-income ratio is relatively stable over the sample period. The findings suggest that household indebtedness is amplifying the recession and the debt repayment burden indicates the mechanism which is at work.},

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to show that household-level financial distress ({FD}) varies greatly, meaning there is unequal exposure to macroeconomic risk, and that {FD} can increase macroeconomic vulnerability. To do this, we first establish three facts: (i) regions in the U.S. vary significantly in their “{FD}-intensity,” measured either by how much additional credit households therein can access, or in how delinquent they typically are on debts, (ii) shocks that are typically viewed as “aggregate” in nature hit geographic areas quite differently, and (iii) {FD} is an economic “pre-existing condition”: the share of an aggregate shock borne by a region is positively correlated with the level of {FD} present at the time of the shock. Using an empirically disciplined and institutionally rich model of consumer debt and default, we show that in the shocks dealt by the Great Recession and in the initial months in the {COVID}-19 pandemic, {FD} mattered. Our model implies that the uneven distribution of {FD} creates widely varying consumption responses to shocks. This is true even when subjecting regions (with differing levels of {FD}) to the same shocks, which highlights the importance of {FD} independently of its correlation with shocks.},

We use a stress-testing framework where the probability of default is evaluated on the basis of the financial margin (i.e. the ability to service debt from current income) and the availability of financial buffers. The {HFCS} data from household interviews are complemented with information from administrative registers. This lets us evaluate and compare measures of financial vulnerability that draw on data from different sources. We derive a set of indicators to identify households that are financially distressed and analyse the sensitivity of financial sector loan losses to adverse shocks. The stress-test elasticities are assessed separately for three standardised negative macroeconomic shocks: a rise in interest rates, an increase in the unemployment rate, and a fall in real estate prices. In addition, we evaluate the impact of a simultaneous shock mimicking the dynamics of these three variables during the Great Recession. It is found that: (1) despite there being a lot of households with financial difficulties, the risks for banks from the household sector are limited; (2) financial fragility is strongly negatively related to income; (3) the loan default rate of households is most sensitive to shocks to the unemployment rate and the interest rate, while the loan losses of banks are affected most by real estate price shocks; and (4) compared with the survey data, the information collected from administrative sources points to higher household default rates and larger bank losses.},

Overbuilding of durable capital such as housing requires a reallocation of productive resources to other sectors, which is facilitated by a reduction in the interest rate. When monetary policy is constrained, overbuilding induces a demand-driven recession with limited reallocation and low output. Investment in other capital initially declines due to low demand, but it later booms and induces an asymmetric recovery in which the overbuilt sector is left behind. Welfare can be improved by ex post policies that stimulate investment (including in overbuilt capital) and ex ante policies that restrict investment.},

	abstract = {Following the global financial crisis, macroprudential regulators in a number of countries took actions to mitigate risks arising from stressed mortgage markets to financial and economic stability. Having disaggregated information on the stock of mortgages allows policymakers to analyse particular cohorts of the market that may be more vulnerable to stress, and model how these cohorts may evolve in the future and might affect the outlook for financial and economic stability. To this end, we produce the first ever estimate of the current stock of all regulated {UK} mortgages at the level of individual loans using data from the flow of new mortgages. We use loan-level information of 14 million {UK} mortgages at the point each loan was originated or re-mortgaged. Using a series of algorithms from Computer Science, we identify individual loans in the flow of lending that are likely to be still in the stock at different points in time. Then we estimate how key characteristics of mortgages (including borrower incomes, house prices and outstanding loan amounts) are likely to have evolved over time since origination. We validate our overall model by comparing key variables to information available from other sources that provide partial characteristics of the stock, including household surveys and regulatory returns. Our stock estimate suggests that there may have been more vulnerable borrowers in recent years than household surveys suggest. Finally, we illustrate the type of cohort analysis that can be done using the loan-level estimate.},

	abstract = {The paper presents an agent-based model to study the interaction between income inequality and prudential regulations in a macroeconomic framework characterized by consumer debt. Simulation results show that income inequality is detrimental to both macro and ﬁnancial stability as it leads to higher credit demands, higher unemployment rates, economic volatility, and ﬁnancial fragility. Besides the importance of consumers’ leveraging, deleveraging externalities are found to be equally important for the emergence of crises and ﬁnancial fragility because of the liquidity risk they entail. Minsky moments are also observed; they are related to consumers’ prudential behavior and their beliefs about the macroeconomic conditions. Concerning the policy relevance of our investigation, simulations allow us to highlight that the eﬀectiveness of prudential regulation depends on the phase of the business cycle and that there is not a “one-size-ﬁts-all” regulation. This study emphasizes that regulatory constraints should take into account the features of the economic agents, such as the distribution of income and their willingness to borrow, in addition to the features of the ﬁnancial sector.},

	abstract = {The paper moves from a discussion of the challenges posed by the crisis to standard macroeconomics and the solutions adopted within the {DSGE} community. Although several recent improvements have enhanced the realism of standard models, we argue that major drawbacks still undermine their reliability. In particular, {DSGE} models still fail to recognize the complex adaptive nature of economic systems, and the implications of money endogeneity. The paper argues that a coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and ﬁnancial sides of the economy should be a pivotal feature of every macroeconomic model and proposes a macroeconomic framework based on the combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. The papers aims at contributing to the nascent {AB}-{SFC} literature under two fundamental respects: ﬁrst, we develop a fully decentralized {AB}-{SFC} model with several innovative features, and we thoroughly validate it in order to check whether the model is a good candidate for policy analysis applications. Results suggest that the properties of the model match many empirical regularities, ranking among the best performers in the related literature, and that these properties are robust across different parameterizations. Second, the paper has also a methodological purpose in that we try to provide a set or rules and tools to build, calibrate, validate, and display {AB}-{SFC} models.},
